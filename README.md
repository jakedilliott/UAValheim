# UA Valheim
Go beyond Plus Ultra with these quality of life and fun Valheim mods! The purpose of this modpack is to provide an easy way for my friends and I to use a common set of both server and client side mods. 

## Included Mods

A huge thank you to all of the authors of the mods included in this modpack. I take no credit for the work done by these wonderful people and would like to use this section to acknowledge their work.

| Mod Package   | Description   | Author    |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| BepInExPack\_Valheim | Stripped DLLs and modding necessities | denikson |
| CraftingWithContainers | Grabs crafting materials from nearby containters | abearcodes |
| SimpleRecycling | Adds a recycling tab to crafting tables | abearcodes |
| FloatingItems | Items in water float to the surface | castix |

| AnyPortal | Menu based portal management | sweetgiorni |

## Installation

Use one of the mod managers available on the [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io). I prefer [rd2modman](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) but the [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) should also work just fine. 

## Servers

For server installation use [mbround/valheim-docker](https://github.com/mbround18/valheim-docker) and follow the [getting started with mods](https://github.com/mbround18/valheim-docker/blob/main/docs/getting_started_with_mods.md) documentation.

***Disclaimer:*** Your mileage may vary! Valheim modding is still in it's infancy and is not officially supported by the developers of Valheim. These settings and configurations work for me with my server setup, and I do not guarantee that this modpack will work properly.
